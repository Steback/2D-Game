# Basic 2D Game
This is my first "serious" project, I decided to create it for a few reasons. Initially, it was to learn how to use some tools and create concepts like Contact system, GUI, Create and load save files and create a basic particle system. I am new in the world of game development; so this project has a lot of bugs and various elements don't work well, this is beacuse I just want to learn how to do that or get a simple idea of how to do it in the future.
